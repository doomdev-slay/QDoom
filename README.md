# QDoom
A port of DOOM that runs on QEMU for Windows and Linux

#### Note: you need qemu downloaded if you want your QDOOM running :)


# Issues

- It has some weird a*s problem with .lmp demo playing so warp to E1M1 is used.
- And it runs on FreeDOS. It isnt actually an issue but it would be a lot cooler if it could run on KERNEL.SYS or some boot sector
